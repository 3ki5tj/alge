Overview
=========

The purpose of the programs here is to sampling a flat distribution in MD
  along a reaction coordinates whose derivatives are not readily computed.
The technique used here is hybrid MC that threat a short MD segment as
  Monte Carlo trial, and accept it only by a probability computed from
  integrating the mean force.


 Code
=======
 *  gomdr:    flat distribution along RMSD in MD
 *  gomcr:    flat distribution along RMSD in MC (for comparison)
 *  gomdnc:   flat distribution along number-of-contacts in MD


Notes
======

In hybrid MC, we have to reset the velocities after a trajectory segment,
  no matter it is accepted or rejected.
Several `smaller' changes are used, first we can multiple all velocities
  by the same 3x3 unitary (rotation + a possible reflection) matrix.
This proves to be working. However, limit to random rotation or reflection
  only does not work.
Trajectory reversal does not work.
