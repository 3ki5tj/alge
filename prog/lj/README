Notes
======
* now use the reflective boundary by default (more robust)
  but has artifacts (with --T0 and --T1 are set to be the same as -T)
  smooth boundary needs a smaller `alf0', see Artifacts for details

* the computed mean force is 1/tp, as shown in `lj.e' u 1:2
  it is not affected by the thermostat temperature

* icc 4m7s vs gcc 4m55s


Bin size
==========
smaller bin size (--dr) requires larger --ac to get a smooth profile


Artifacts v1.1
================
as of b8b489f57025307766a73addd155f3e7eecb2a51

Symptoms
~~~~~~~~~
* At the boundary `lj.e' dips at the last bin
  but no visible effect at the left boundary

* a sharp peak in the histogram immediately at the right of the right boundary (>epmax)

Diagnosis
~~~~~~~~~~
This is due to that the temperature outside of (xmin, xmax) has been set to tp0

The symptoms vanishes if with a smooth boundary condition (-b 0)
However this solution must be accompanied by a small --a0,
otherwise, the system can easily flow outside of the range


Other attempts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* affects both ljmd.c and ljmc.c

* < e^2 > slightly dips the at the right boundary (larger U) for ljmc

* same amount of drift --a0 0.01 (default 0.1)
* same amount of drift to --ac 10.0 (default 1.0)

* domain-inverted (-epmax, -epmin) version shows the drift
  also presents at the high energy end (epmax), so it is not
  due to a programming error about 0 and al->n - 1

* not due to the bin size
  with --dr 1, the drift affects several bins at the right boundary

* the drift reduces with `tpstat' (-T) set to 3.0 (default 1.0)
  which is closer to the temperature of the high energy boundary
* the drift reduces with the new options --T0 1 --T1 3

* alged_getdenam(), arithematic mean for < e^2 >, same result
  suggesting that the artifact is due to the downward `inertia'
  beyond the right boundary because tpmax << tpstat,
  shifting `< du >', hence the mean-force estimate, downwards
